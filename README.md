# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker-Exercise
This is the Real Time Tracker Exercise from Module 9, where we use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to add animation to an embed MapBox.

How to Run:
-Go to the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repository.
-Select "Clone" to clone file on you computer.
-Go to your file browser on you computer.
-Open cloned Real-Time-Bus-Tracker file folder.
-Select the index.html and open it using your internet browser.

Future Improvements:
I would like to add text boxes to the markers to shar details about the featured bus stops.
